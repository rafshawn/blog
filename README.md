I compiled my notes in Joplin. Joplin is great, don't get me wrong--but I also wanted to create a wikidocs styled static page where I can access all my learning in like a webpage and whenever I feel like it.

Hopefully as I build this up, people can also take advantage of it as a silly (but free!) learning or review source. It's certainly meant for my notetaking and review!

The notes here are meant to be refined and compiled after I write things down to understand concepts well enough. i.e., No room for half-baked or unseasoned content (hopefully)!
